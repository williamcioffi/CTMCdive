\title{Estimate exposure effect for dive and surface intensity}
\usage{
GetExposureEffonIntensity(mod, predgrid, basedat, nsims = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{fitted CTMC model}

\item{predgrid}{data frame with same columns as data but with a user-defined
time grid to estimate the effect over must have a column which is 1 when
exposure is one and zero otherwise}

\item{basedat}{baseline data}

\item{nsims}{number of posterior simulations, default is 1000}
}
\value{
list with dive and surface elements which each contain the mean exposure effect and the credible interval bands
}
