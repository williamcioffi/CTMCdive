\arguments{
\item{x}{fitted CTMCdive model}

\item{quant}{the quantile to plot the observed data up to, for example if set to 0.95 then only the durations up to the 95\% quantile are plotted (prevents outliers dominating the plot)}

\item{pick}{if not \code{NULL} then either "dive" or "surface" if only want a plot of one of the fitted
processes}

\item{pred}{if predicted means already computed can supply them here rather than have them recomputed}

\item{xlim}{limits for x axis if you want to restrict range}

\item{se}{display uncertainty bands around the lines (takes time to compute)}

\item{n_samp}{number of posterior samples to use if \code{se=TRUE}, otherwise ignored}

\item{pch}{what plot character to use for the points}

\item{cex}{size of points}

\item{\dots}{unused (for S3 compatability)}
}
\value{
plots of dive and surface durations or only one of if "\code{pick}" is specified
}

Plot models fitted by \code{CTMCdive}.
